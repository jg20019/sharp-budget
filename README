Budget App 

Overview 
A simple budgeting app.

How It Works
Users enter how much they have earned in their paycheck. 
The app calculates how much of their check should go 
towards needs, wants, and debt and savings goals. 

The app uses the 50-30-20 rule in this calculation.
- 50% of the income goes towards needs
- 30% of the income goes towards wants 
- 20% of the income goes towards savings/debts  

Each user has 3 accounts from which to record
expenses. 

Needs
Wants 
Savings/Debts

Every time a purchase is made it comes from one of these 3 accounts. 
If a purchase exceeds a given category, the remainder can come from 
another account as long as there are sufficient funds.
